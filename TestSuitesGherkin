SUMMARY: 

AsapTech is an application that gives users the tools they need to work as a team to process help desk tickets. The system will allow Admin users to manage ticket flow and remove or add team members. The system will allow for status updates on tickets and will show the necessary details for knowing what a ticket is for, who handled the ticket, and at what time and date. 
There will be a sign-in and sign-up page for accounts, and one for Technicians. The first admin created will be able to create new admins as needed. 

For the purpose of this doc: 
Users = Customers 
Techs = Admin Users i.e. Accounts with access to ticket processing tools
SuperAdmin = Admin with all the keys to the castle :) ( this one cannot be deleted)
